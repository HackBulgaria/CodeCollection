# Check if integer is prime 

 Check if a given integer is a prime number. 

Given an integer, implement a function, called ```is_prime(n)``` which returns True if n is a prime number. You should handle the case with negative numbers too.

A primer number is a number, that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

1 is not considered to be a prime number. [If you are curious why, find out here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQofiPqhJ_s)

def is_prime(n):
    # implementation
```

### Test examples

>>> is_prime(1)
False
>>> is_prime(2)

>>> is_prime(8)
False
>>> is_prime(11)
