# prime number of divisors 

 Check if a given number has a prime number of divisors 

Given an integer, implement a function, called ```prime_number_of_divisors(n)``` which returns True if the number of divisors of n is a prime number. False otherwise.

For example, the divisors of 8 are 1,2,4 and 8, a total of 4. 4 is not a prime.
The divisors of 9 are 1,3 and 9, a total of 3, which is a prime number.

### Signature

```python
def prime_number_of_divisors(n):

### Test examples

```
>>> prime_number_of_divisors(7)
True
>>> prime_number_of_divisors(8)
False
>>> prime_number_of_divisors(9)
True
