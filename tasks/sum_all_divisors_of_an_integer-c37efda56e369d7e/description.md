# Sum all divisors of an integer 

 Find the sum of all divisiors of a given integer. 

 Given an integer, implement a function, called `sum_of_divisors(n)` that calculates the sum of all divisors of n.

 For example, the divisors of 8 are 1,2,4 and 8 and `1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15`
 The divisors of 7 are 1 and 7, which makes the sum = 8

### Signature

```python
def sum_of_divisors(n):
    # implementation
```

### Test examples

```
>>> sum_of_divisors(8)
15
>>> sum_of_divisors(7)
8
>>> sum_of_divisors(1)
1
>>> sum_of_divisors(1000)
2340
```
